                <p>
                    Kayla’s House was born from unimaginable loss and enduring love. 
                    Founded in November 2025 in memory of our beloved Kayla Rincon, this nonprofit was created after her life was tragically taken by gun violence. 
                </p>

                <p>
                     While our hearts were broken, our mission became clear.
                     Kayla’s House exists to raise awareness about gun violence among young teens, 
                     to educate and empower families, and to inspire communities to choose prevention, compassion, and action. 
                </p>

                <p>
                     Through every life we reach and every conversation we start, we honor Kayla’s legacy by working toward a future where no child’s life is cut short and no family has to endure this pain.
                <br>✨ Her light lives on through change.
